		+ added auth_<method>.c, each basic auth-method has now
		  its own implementation-file
		+ added -auth - flag:
			- list      - lists all available methods
			- none      - no auth, like -nolock
			- passwd    - standard login, possible shadowsupport
			- pam       - use pam for authentification
			- md5:hash  - provide a md5-hash for authentification
	* support for 'shadow'-passwords is part of the passwd authmodule

2005-05-06:

	* added -nolock
	* discard all pending xevents after wrong password to prevent
	  strange folks for blocking the current session by filling
	  the eventqueue with wrong authentification and thus block
	  the real authentification (kind of denial of service :)
	* added suuport to load / have different cursor-shapes
		+ -cursor theme|<format>:<filename>
	* added support for xcursor
	* restructuring
		+ contrib/ -> for stuff coming from the "outside"
