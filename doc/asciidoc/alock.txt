ALOCK(1)
========
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
alock - locks the local X display until the correct password is entered


SYNOPSIS
--------
*alock* [-help] [-modules] [-auth type:opts] [-bg type:opts] [-cursor type:opts] [-input type:opts]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*Alock* is a simple screen lock application, which locks the X server until
the correct password is provided. If the authentication was successful, the X
server is unlocked and the user can continue to work. When *alock* is started
it just waits for the first keypress. This first keypress is to indicate that
the user now wants to type in the password. Such a behavior might seem to be
annoying at the first glance, however this approach is chosen due to security
reasons.

Note, that *alock* does not provide any fancy animations like 'xlock' and
'xscreensaver' and probably never will. It's just for locking the current X
session.


OPTIONS
-------
*-h*, *-help*::
    Print a short help

*-m*, *-modules*::
    List available (compiled in) module types

*-a*, *-auth* 'type:options'::
    Define the type of the authentication, depends strongly on
    how alock was built:
    - none - No authentication at all
    - pam - Tries to authenticate against the users system-password
            using the 'pam-login'-module.
    - passwd - Tries to authenticate against the users system-password.
               On systems using 'shadow' alock needs the suid-flag set.
		- hash - Authenticates using arbitrary hash comparison.
        * list - display available hashing algorithms
        * type=<type> - use <type> hashing algorithm
        * hash=<hash> - use <hash> as reference
        * file=<filename> - use content of <filename> as reference

*-b*, *-bg* 'type:options'::
    Define the type of how alock should handle the background:
    - none - You can see everything like it is
    - blank - Fill the background with color
        * color=<color> - use <color>
    - shade - Dims content of the screen and recolors it.
        * color=<color> - use <color>
        * shade=<percent> - valid from 1 to 99
        * mono - convert to monochrome
    - image - Use the image <filename> and puts it as the background
        * file=<filename>
        * center
        * scale
        * tiled
        * color=<color> - use <color>
        * shade=<percent> - valid from 1 to 99

*-c*, *-cursor* 'type:options'::
    Define the look-a-like of the cursor/mouse pointer:
    - none - No change to the current cursor
    - glyph - Use the given glyph of the "cursor"-font
        * list - Display all possible glyph-names
        * name=<name>
        * bg=<color>
        * fg=<color>
    - xcursor - Use the given <filename> in xcursor-format
        * file=<filename> 
    - image - Use the given <filename>
        * file=<filename>

*-i*, *-input* 'type:options'::
    Define the type of the input indicator, which should be used while typing
		password:
    - none - No input feedback for user
    - frame - Display frame on the current display
        * width=<width> - the frame width, valid from 1 upwards
        * input=<color> - use <color> while typing
        * check=<color> - use <color> while checking password
        * error=<color> - use <color> upon authentication error
